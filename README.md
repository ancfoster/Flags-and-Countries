# Flags & Countries
Flags & Countries is an interactive responsive geography quiz game.

## Design Process

### UX Design Process

#### User Stories
- As a user I would like to improve my knowledge of world flags.
- As a user I wish to improve my students' geography knowledge in a fun way.  

#### Game Design
##### Game elements
-	220 countries/territories in the game list
-	To win a user must answer 70 questions correctly
-	If they answer a question incorrectly, they lose and must start over.
-	There are 7 questions in each level and 10 levels
-	There are two question formats and these alternate
	- What is the flag of [country name]? (User then picks one of 3 flag pictures)
	- This is the flag of . . .   (User then picks a country name from a list of three countries) 
-	The levels get progressively harder.
-	Maximum score of 70 with 1 point per correct answer
- 	The game is multiple-choice with 3 options per question.


### Colour Scheme
    explain your colors, etc.... perhaps use coolors.co? to generate an image palette
### Typography

Adobe Fonts:
- [Objektiv](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/objektiv) is the fotn used for the H1 and H2 tags

- [Elza](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/elza) is used for all other elements containing text. I picked it for its modern minimalism and readability

### Wireframes
     include screenshots of your wireframes (consider the markdown table format)
## Features
    briefly explain the project
### Existing Features
    list out all of your project's features, and make sure to include a screenshot of each!!
### Features Left to Implement
- Autosave and saving game progress. If a user leaves the website in the middle of a game their progress will have been saved to local storage.
- Global scoreboard that ranks users on how many questions they answered and how quickly.
## Technologies Used

- HTML 5
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Tools used
- For writing code I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which I also for Git commands and pushing to GitHub

- [GitHub](https://github.com]) was used for hosting the online repository, it provides an online version of Git, a source code management tool.

- Adobe Illustrator was used for vector graphic design, like for the logo, coral reef list bullets and map.

- [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) was used to create high fidelity mockups before I started coding. 

- [Markdown Editor](https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/markdown-editor/id1458220908?mt=12) by Satoshi Iwaki was used for editing .MD files.

	- *In both of my .MD files I have used the HTML image tag in certain situtions. The Markdown syntax does not support [specifiying image size](https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/#image-size) width which was necessary for readability of these doucments.*

- [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) was used to add browser specifc prefixes.

- Adobe Illustrator was used to make several of the game graphics including the score icon and the game complete graphics

- MDN documentation on using [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) 
- MDN documentation on how to use [JSON stringify and parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) which was used for the storage and retrieval of multiple player names + scores in localStorage.
